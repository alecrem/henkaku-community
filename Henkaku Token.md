Some notes on a potential token for 変革会.

## Summary

- The tokens do not have any commercial value and any activity that suggests that the tokens have commercial value is forbidden.
- The tokens will be issued to community members as rewards for activities that benefit the community such as participating in events, help organizing events, contributing code, ideas, text or other scholarly and community-oriented content to community projects.
- The tokens will be used to provide access to events and in exchange for rewards that have community value, but not commercial value.
- Things received in exchange for the tokens may not be sold or traded for money or anything of commercial value.
- Tokens maybe traded to other community members in exchanges for goods and services that have no commercial value.

## Commercial Value

- Money,  objects that can easily be sold for money or anything that is frequently sold for money represents things that have commercial value.
- Some times of labor have obvious commercial value. For example, a lawyer who always charges for their time should not provide such professional services in exchange for tokens. On the other hand, if the lawyer engages in substantial pro bono (unpaid and volunteer) services, pro bono hours could be classified and non-commercial and traded for tokens.
- Things that can not be sold for money such as scholarly credentials do not have commercial value.

## The Community

- Tokens are only valid when held by active community members.
- Any member breaking community roles will be banned from the community and not permitted to participate in any community event or transaction.
- Tokens will be used by community members to permit voting on community decision, providing access to community events and other features of the community.
