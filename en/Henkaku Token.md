# Henkaku Tokens

Draft December 1, 2021 - 09:36:19

Henkaku tokens are a non-commercial, social token for the 変革会 community. The tokens will be distributed to community members for non-commercial contributions to the community, for example, providing feedback and comments to Joi Ito's Podcast, participating in and helping with community events and writing and creating content for the community.

The tokens can used to vote on community decisions.The community may also conduct events or create communication channels available only to token holders. The token may also be traded between members of the community in exchange for non-commercial social activity such as advice or help on projects.

## Rules

Breaching any of the following rules will cause the member to be banned from the community indefinitely. The community may halt all trading and freeze the currency if the breach is irreversibly severe.

- The tokens may only be held by community members and may never be given or traded to non-community members.
- The tokens do not have any commercial value and any activity that suggests that the tokens have commercial value is forbidden.
- Members providing services, objects or access to information or communications may not provide anything that can also be purchases for money. For example, any events which can be attended by spending tokens may not also sell access for money. Any items given in exchange for token may not be items that can be purchased for money.
