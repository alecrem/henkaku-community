# The Henkaku Token

Draft December 4, 2021 - 15:09:43

Version 0.3 beta

Henkaku tokens are a non-commercial, social token for the Henkaku community. The tokens will be distributed to community members for non-commercial contributions to the community, for example, providing feedback and comments to Joi Ito's Podcast, participating in and helping with community events and writing and creating content for the community. Community members cannot sell or purchase tokens.

The tokens can be used to vote on community decisions. The community may also conduct events or create communication channels available only to token holders. The token may also be traded between members of the community in exchange for non-commercial social activity such as advice or help on projects.

## Rules

Breaching any of the following rules will cause the member to be banned from the community indefinitely. The community may halt all trading and freeze the currency if the breach is irreversibly severe.

* The tokens may only be held by community members and may never be given or traded to non-community members.
* The tokens do not have any commercial value and any activity that suggests that the tokens have commercial value is forbidden.
* Members providing services, objects or access to information or communications may not provide anything that can also be purchases for money. For example, any events which can be attended by spending tokens may not also sell access for money. Any items given in exchange for token may not be items that can be purchased for money. In particular, purchase and sales of the token for cash or exchanging the token with cryptocurrencies are strictly prohibited.

## How To Get Tokens
* From your PC, please follow the steps below (Chrome and Brave are recommended).
* In order to join the community, please fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/shrO7yOVqbeymYSOW) and provide your ETH address. If you don't have a wallet, please install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) or the equivalent. Instructions in Japanese [here](https://joi.ito.com/jp/archives/2021/11/08/005731.html).
* You must have Polygon configured on your wallet. You can see instructions for MetaMask [here](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/).
  * Open MetaMask and click on the Network Selection drop-down.
  * Select Custom RPC and enter the following information.
    * Network Name: Polygon Mainnet
    * New RPC URL: https://polygon-rpc.com/
    * Chain ID: 137
    * Currency Symbol: MATIC
    * Block Explorer URL: https://polygonscan.com
* To add the token on MetaMask so you can see it, scroll to the bottom of the Assets section of the wallet, click "Import Tokens" and enter the token contract address `0xd59FFEE93A55F67CeD0F56fa4A991d4c8c8f5C4E`.
  * If you see 0 HENKAKU, you are done setting up your wallet.
  * The token address on the Polygon blockchain is : [0xd59FFEE93A55F67CeD0F56fa4A991d4c8c8f5C4E](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xd59FFEE93A55F67CeD0F56fa4A991d4c8c8f5C4E) and is called $HENKAKU.
* Login to Henkaku Discord server and read ðŸ‘‹welcome and ðŸš€start-here. Follow the instructions to gain access to the other channels.
* After introducing yourself in the #member channel, go to the #join channel and enter the `c!register` command.
  * You will receive a DM from an account called coinvise-bot. Please follow the instructions and the DM which will ask you to connect to your MetaMask or other wallet and then verify your ETH address. You will need to click on the text on the page that says "Verify using MetaMask" (or other wallet).
  * :note: Some scammers with the same name as the bot may send you a DM and try to steal from you by getting you to connect your wallet to a fake service. The correct coinvise-bot is called `coinvise-bot#4309`.
  * :note: In general, it is best to turn DM "Allow direct messages from server members." off when not interacting with bots. This setting can be found in under the `Privacy Settings`, accessible by clicking `Henkaku` on the top left of the window. The default setting may already be set off, in which case you will need to turn it on to get the link from `coinvise-bot`. [See this support page](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/217916488-Blocking-Privacy-Settings-).
* Once MetaMask is linked to Discord, community members can give you $HENKAKU tokens.
* In order to transfer $HENKAKU after you receive some, you will need $MATIC to pay for the gas/transaction fee. Currently, it is difficult to get in Japan so please ask someone on Discord to give you some or [try a faucet](https://matic.supply). The transaction fees are very low so you don't need very much to be able to give $HENKAKU to others.

## How To Use Token

* We are using [snapshots.org](https://snapshot.org/#/henkaku.eth/) to create and vote on community proposals.
* snapshot is only available to token holders.
