# The Henkaku Token

Draft December 4, 2021 - 15:09:43

Version 0.2 beta

Henkaku tokens are a non-commercial, social token for the Henkaku community. The tokens will be distributed to community members for non-commercial contributions to the community, for example, providing feedback and comments to Joi Ito's Podcast, participating in and helping with community events and writing and creating content for the community. Community members cannot sell or purchase tokens.

The tokens can be used to vote on community decisions. The community may also conduct events or create communication channels available only to token holders. The token may also be traded between members of the community in exchange for non-commercial social activity such as advice or help on projects.

## Rules

Breaching any of the following rules will cause the member to be banned from the community indefinitely. The community may halt all trading and freeze the currency if the breach is irreversibly severe.

* The tokens may only be held by community members and may never be given or traded to non-community members.
* The tokens do not have any commercial value and any activity that suggests that the tokens have commercial value is forbidden.
* Members providing services, objects or access to information or communications may not provide anything that can also be purchases for money. For example, any events which can be attended by spending tokens may not also sell access for money. Any items given in exchange for token may not be items that can be purchased for money. In particular, purchase and sales of the token for cash or exchanging the token with cryptocurrencies are strictly prohibited.

## How To Get Token

* In order to be a community member, please fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/shrO7yOVqbeymYSOW) and provide your ETH address. If you don't have a wallet, please install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) or the equivalent. Instructions in Japanese [here](https://joi.ito.com/jp/archives/2021/11/08/005731.html).
* You must have Polygon configured on your wallet. You can see instructions for MetaMask [here](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/).
  * Open MetaMask and click on the Network Selection drop-down
  * Select Custom RPC and enter the following information
    * Network Name: Polygon Mainnet
    * New RPC URL: https://polygon-rpc.com/
    * Chain ID: 137
    * Currency Symbol: MATIC
    * Block Explorer URL: https://polygonscan.com
* To add the token on MetaMask so you can see it, scroll to the bottom of the Assets section of the wallet, click "Import Tokens" and enter the token contract address `0xd59FFEE93A55F67CeD0F56fa4A991d4c8c8f5C4E`.
  * If you see 0 HENAKAKU, you are done setting up your wallet.
  * The token address on the Polygon blockchain is : [0xd59FFEE93A55F67CeD0F56fa4A991d4c8c8f5C4E](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xd59FFEE93A55F67CeD0F56fa4A991d4c8c8f5C4E) and is called $HENKAKU.
* Login to Henkaku Discord and read ðŸ‘‹wellcome and ðŸš€start-here. Follow the directions to gain access to the other channels.
* After saying hello in the #member channel, hit the `!register` command.
  * You will get a DM from an account called Collab.Land. Please follow the instructions of this account to link MetaMask.
  * :note: Some scam users with the same name as the bot may send you a message, so please check visually before clicking on the link to see if it is a bot.
  * :note: The default setting may be blocking DMs, so please check [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/ja/articles/217916488-%E3%83%96%E3%83%AD%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%81% A8%E3%83%97%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%90%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC%E8%A8%AD%E5%AE%9A).
* Once MetaMask is linked to Discord, community members will give you a $HENAKU token.
* In order to transfer $HENKAKU after you receive some, you will need $MATIC to pay for the gas/transaction fee. Currently, it is difficult to get in Japan so please ask someone on Discord to give you some. The transaction fees are very low so you don't need very much to be able to give $HENKAKU to others.
