## About the Coinvise bot

### Q: The Coinvise bot replied to my tipping command with "Invalid format"

1. Confirm that the format was correct: `c!tip @tippee henkaku matic 10` where `@user_to_tip` is the Discord user to receive the tip, and `10` is the amount of `$HENKAKU` that you want to give them
1. Send `c!register 0x...` again, where `0x...` is your Ethereum address
1. @coinvise-bot will send you a DM with a link for you to complete verification using your wallet (at no ETH or MATIC cost)
1. Retry the tip command after doing so

## About Snapshot and proposals

### Q: My voting power is different from the amount of $HENKAKU on my address
- Voting power for a given proposal is the amount of $HENKAKU the voter held when the proposal was published. It is not relevant if at the time of voting the voter's $HENKAKU has increased.
